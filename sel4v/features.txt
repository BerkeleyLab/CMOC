On-chip computer (J1 or similar?)

Network packet gateway

Pulse-ID triggered sequence player
  16-bit wide RAM, 64 or 1K deep
  3 word pulse ID or 1 word continue instruction (47 bit)
    Negotiable if this is FPGA cycle count or gun RF cycle ID,
    ratio is 185.714 MHz / 94.286 MHz = 65/33
    or maybe laser clock, 37.143 MHz / 94.286 MHz = 13/264,
    but that factor of 5 is not very deeply cast into this accelerator.
    Probably not "1 MHz" number, a factor of 40 slower yet.
  1 word destination address
  2 word data
  upper level can read and write current execution address
  writable stop address

Function generator
  pulse with adjustable rise time/fall time
  linear or quadratic phase generator
  optional CORDIC
  optional sqrt(x)
  A*f + B*df/dt
  selectable destination address
  mailbox for use by computer as math engine

High-speed LLRF logic:
  near-IQ downconvert
  fdbk_core
    add feedforward control?
  2 x lp1_io forming low-pass plus notch filter
  amplifier linearizer

how to hook the waveform capture up to this stack?
  N x simple downconverters
  conveyor belt triggered at f/33
  multiple clients
