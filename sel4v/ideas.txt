Want ramps on "everything" esp:
  set points
  limits

Add squelch to phase+poffset path in mp_proc, to allow clean start from zero amplitude

Three key steps in sel4:
  autoset ph_offset (goes with squelch)
  different clip/wrap behavior for setpoint subtract of mag and phase
  binary gain of 16 before and 1,8,64 after the multiply

Could almost dispense with the multiply entirely: at total gain of 1024
(extending BW from 20 Hz to 20 kHz) we only have 8 bits of theoretical
signal left, and about 3 of those are guard bits.  If this were true
custom hardware, I'd pick about a 7x4 multiplier plus barrel shifter.
Well, it might need more bits at lower gains.

Accumulator width set by needing to be robust in the face of input word
with significant bits in varying position.

Clip levels: want to stay linear in the face of Gaussian noise.
Hope for +/- 6 sigma, but +/- 4 sigma would probably be OK.
But also don't want to instantly clip the output amplifier.

Wish for the following gains:
  proportional gain of 1000 to push cavity from 20 Hz to 20 kHz
  integral gain of 1000 at  5 kHz when not using low-latency path
  integral gain of 4000 at 20 kHz when using low-latency path
  remember each component is operated on at clk/8
1000*(5e3*2*pi)/(100e6/8) = 2.5
4000*(20e3*2*pi)/(100e6/8) = 40 /update.  Yowza.

Additional gain from CORDIC setup: amplitude loop always includes
cg^2/2 = 1.3559.  Phase loop takes phase (as a fraction of 2*pi)
as input, but Q as output.  So if that element has gain of A, the
small-signal loop gain is A / (I component) / (2*pi).

The largest proportional phase gain is therefore .. not sure yet. XXX

For now we're going to try 10 kHz cavity, ~110 cycles delay including
1 MHz bandwidth limiter, 100 kHz closed loop bandwidth, gain of 10.
The abstract integral term will have gain of 10 at 30 kHz:
10*(30e3*2*pi)/(100e6/8) = 0.151
If the path is set up for 64 radians/cycle max with coefficient 2^17,
coeff is 309.  Proportional gain 10/1024*2^17 = 1280.  These are for
Amplitude path:
  proportional  10 /  1024 / (cg^2/2) * (2^17) = 944
  integral      0.151 / 16 / (cg^2/2) * (2^17) = 912
Phase path, given amplitude loop locked at 30000
  proportional  10 /  1024 * 30000 = 293
  integral      0.151 / 16 * 30000 = 283
