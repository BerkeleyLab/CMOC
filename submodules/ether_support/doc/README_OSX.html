<h1>Simulating Verilog Ethernet on OS X</h1>
<p>
With a little effort the simulated network example can be made to work on OS X.<br>
<h2>Preliminary</h2>
<p>
Install the TAP network interface from the prebuilt package (you need install only the TAP portion of the package):<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/">http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/</a><br>
or from the project source:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; git clone git://tuntaposx.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/tuntaposx/tuntaposx <br>
or from 'Ports':<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; port install tuntaposx<br>
<p>
The OS X TAP network interface has some 'features' that make it a little less convenient than the Linux equivalent:
<ul>
  <li>There is no mechanism to automatically allocate a free TAP network
 interface. Instead, you must choose one explicitly and pass that
value to the simulator using the VVP_NETWORK_NAME environment variable.
  <li>The network interface is picky about being opened only once, so it
is necessary to configure the network interface (ifconfig) after the
simulation has started. It can't be configured earlier, since the
network interface does not exist until a process opens it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The following is a step-by-step guide to starting a simulator
session. You'll need to replace the values in angle brackets with
settings appropriate to your
situation. The first two steps need be done only once per TAP network interface.
<ol>
  <li>Choose a TAP network interface to assign to the VVP_NETWORK_NAME
environment variable. The simulator will default to "tap0" if this
 environment variable is not set.<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; export VVP_NETWORK_NAME=tap1</span>
  <li>As root, provide access to the chosen TAP network interface device entry.<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span><span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo chmod 666 /dev/$VVP_NETWORK_NAME</span><br>
or<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chown &lt;your_user_id&gt; /dev/$VVP_NETWORK_NAME</span>
  <li>Start the simulator. You'll see complaints about inability to read from the TAP network interface.
  <li>As root, configure the TAP network interface and bring it up.<br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sudo ifconfig $VVP_NETWORK_NAME &lt;network_address_on_same_network_as_simulation&gt; up</span><br>
You should see the simulation begin spewing a line for each simulation
clock step. The simulated network device can now be treated as any
other.
  </li>
</ol>
