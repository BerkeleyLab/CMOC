How to make GTP instantiation for Spartan-6
  particularly the SFP interface on SP605.
  GTP mapping on SP605 according to UG526, UG385, and UG386:
    PCIe Rx/Tx pins C7,  D7,  A6,  B6     Bank 101 (GTPA1_DUAL_X0Y0) GTP0
    SMA  Rx/Tx pins C9,  D9,  A8,  B8     Bank 101 (GTPA1_DUAL_X0Y0) GTP1
    SFP  Rx/Tx pins D13, C13, B14, A14    Bank 123 (GTPA1_DUAL_X1Y0) GTP0
    FMC  Rx/Tx pins B16, A16, D15, C15    Bank 123 (GTPA1_DUAL_X1Y0) GTP1
  Each bank has two available refclks?
    MGTREFCLK0*_101  A10/B10  PCIE_250M
    MGTREFCLK1*_101  C11/D11  SMA_REFCLK
    MGTREFCLK0*_123  A12/B12  SFPCLK_QO
    MGTREFCLK1*_123  E12/F12  FMC_GBTCLK0_M2C

1. setup Xilinx 12.1
2. run coregen
3. make a stupid new project
4. Select chip: Spartan-6 XC6SLX45T-FGG484-3
5. Generate: Verilog
6. Expand left-hand menu tree: FPGA Features and Design/IO Interfaces/
7. Click "Spartan-6 FPGA GTP Transceiver Wizard"
8. Right-hand pane under Actions, click "Customize and Generate"
   page 1 of 11: Select GTPA1_DUAL_X1_Y0, un-select GTPA1_DUAL_X0_Y0
   page 2 of 11: Protocol Template "gigabit ethernet"
      (this is where to turn off 8b/10b encoding)
   page 3 of 11: Select only TXRUNDISP and RXCHARISK
   page 4-10 of 11: take defaults (my eyes are glazing over, GigE defaults
      should be right, and a lot of it doesn't apply)
   page 11 of 11: summary, click "Generate"
9. Resulting files are
   s6_gtpwizard_v1_5_tile.v (module S6_GTPWIZARD_V1_5_TILE, instantiates GTPA1_DUAL)
   s6_gtpwizard_v1_5.v (module S6_GTPWIZARD_V1_5, instantiates S6_GTPWIZARD_V1_5_TILE)
   The latter file looks useless, the former has all the magic PLL constants.
